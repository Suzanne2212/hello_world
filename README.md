# hello_world
This is the first try at figuring out github. I'm hoping to use this for tech writing integration to the Olea website or at least the apps or something.

I will need to learn:
- how to include photos and video and gifs properly
- who is in charge of the website to mke sure this is a good way to do this.
- how to use this for release notes eventually. 
- Do I even need to do this? Do I just write the thing and be dome with it?

## Here's an H2 for the fun of it!
